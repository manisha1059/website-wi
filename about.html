      <h1>About Wane Instruments</h1>
      <p>
        "We, the team behind Wane Instruments (WI), officially declare the launch of a new standard in embedded hardware innovation and mobile system design.
        <br><br>
        Wane Instruments is built on a foundation of precision engineering, bold experimentation, and an obsession with refining every detail. Our mission is to reduce the physical scale of technology while expanding its possibilities and performance.
        <br><br>
        Our core belief is simple: less bulk, more brilliance. Every board, every byte, and every bolt of our design is aimed toward maximum efficiency with zero compromise on experience.
        <br><br>
        We operate with full transparency, following international compliance standards and internal legal audits. All policies are crafted with ethical design, sustainability, and data privacy in mind.
        <br><br>
        "We are not just shipping devices — we're delivering ideas engineered into reality."
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>To engineer the smallest yet most powerful devices that redefine what tech can do, without compromise on performance, ethics, or sustainability.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design futuristic, edge-to-edge mobile devices with deeply integrated hardware and software.</li>
        <li>Bridge the physical world with embedded intelligence using custom-built systems.</li>
        <li>Support developers, students, and industries through innovation-ready platforms.</li>
      </ul>
